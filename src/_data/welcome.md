Thank you for checking out our charity for keeping our home! Right now is a terrifyting time in all of our lives and we need as much help as we can get. Before I get too much into the story, I guess I should introduce who "we" is. We are mayselfs my fiance/partner Lisa Heusner, our dog Magnolia and our two small kitties Zulu and Beaux.
